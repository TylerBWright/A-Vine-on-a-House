I recently read a little story written by Ambrose Bierce in 1905 about creeping vine on a forgotten house. I was surprised to discover the uncanny resemblance shared between Ambrose's house with an abandoned house that my mother and I explored a couple of years back--down its the very location (somewhere between Missouri and Iowa). Just like the story, our house had its own mysterious vine that claimed it as its own.

This multimedia project blends the old with the new, offering a new dimension to this timeless tale. If you enjoy this game, consider reading more of Ambrose's masterful horror... lots of bizarre stuff.

Note: This game is best enjoyed on a desktop computer, however it may still run on a mobile device.
