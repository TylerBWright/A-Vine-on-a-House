I recently read a little story written by Ambrose Bierce in 1905 about creeping vine on a forgotten house. I was surprised to discover the uncanny resemblance shared between Ambrose's house with an abandoned house that my mother and I explored a couple of years back--down its the very location (somewhere between Missouri and Iowa). Just like the story, our house had its own mysterious vine that claimed it as its own.

This game blends photographs from our abandoned house encounter along with the short story, offering a unique new experience. If you enjoy this game, do consider reading more of Ambrose's masterful horror!

Note: This game is best enjoyed on a desktop computer, however it may still run on a mobile device.
